Let's go to learn new things:   
    
What is Network:      
         It is a group of two computer or more that can share information between them (The purpose of a network is to enable communication and data sharing between devices.)   
Type of Netwok:   
         We have 4 type of networking    
         1.PAN  (Personal Area Network):   
                  for Personal devive    
                  (e.g. Phone, computer, other device..)   
         2.LAN (Local Area Network) :           
                  Group of devives that connnected to the Wi-Fi (inside of our Wi-fi box has a switch and router do not worry about that we will clarify it more)   
                  (e.g: cluster, home)    
         3.WAN (Wide Area Network) :   
                  is a group of LAN 
                \t  e.g: group of houses.   
         4.MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):    
                  e.g: A company with offices in different cities or countries connected to the same network.
